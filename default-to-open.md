# Default to open

### Overview <a href="docs-internal-guid-d770374d-7fff-ba15-10f8-6e02daaadc5b" id="docs-internal-guid-d770374d-7fff-ba15-10f8-6e02daaadc5b"></a>

Openness is a mindset and culture. It creates opportunities for exponential government innovation. By embracing the values of collaboration, participation and transparency, we can instill trust and foster better and faster solutions to small and big problems.

### The problem

When we isolate government processes and decision-making from the public, we limit the opportunity to truly create government with, for and by the people. By taking an insular approach to service, we don’t leverage the collective wisdom and energy of the public. The opaqueness leads to ambivalence and mistrust.

### The solution

A government culture of ‘open by default’ that publicly shares information and processes – internally and externally –  and actively solicits feedback. By creating mechanisms that encourage staff and the public to engage early and often, we develop opportunities for increased participation and collaboration in the context of trust and a sense of betterment for the entire community. This builds universal recognition and respect for openness.

### Context

Openness is an ethos that organizations — public and private — adopt so they can be more adaptive and responsive to the people they serve.

The term ‘open government’ was actively socialized by the White House starting in January 2009, when President Barack Obama signed the “Memorandum on Transparency and Open Government,” calling for public sector transparency, participation and collaboration:

“Transparency promotes accountability by providing the public with information about what the Government is doing. Participation allows members of the public to contribute ideas and expertise so that their government can make policies with the benefit of information that is widely dispersed in society. Collaboration improves the effectiveness of Government by encouraging partnerships and cooperation within the Federal Government, across levels of government, and between the Government and private institutions.”

President Obama’s broader openness effort – the Open Government Initiative – ushered in an era of more modern technology and operations adoption,  such as open source software and open data, as well as innovative engagement, including public challenges and input.

Government technologists and designers have been early adopters to a culture of openness, and this has been formally documented in play 13 – “Default to open” –  of the U.S. government Digital Services Playbook:

“When we collaborate in the open and publish our data publicly, we can improve Government together. By building services more openly and publishing open data, we simplify the public’s access to government services and information, allow the public to contribute easily, and enable reuse by entrepreneurs, nonprofits, other agencies, and the public.”

The United Kingdom (UK) government GOV.UK team is another example of government actively embracing openness, including a public roadmap that shows “what we’re working on and planning to do.”

From its official design principles:

“We should share what we’re doing whenever we can. With colleagues, with users, with the world. Share code, share designs, share ideas, share intentions, share failures. The more eyes there are on a service the better it gets — howlers are spotted, better alternatives are pointed out, the bar is raised.”

The Open Organization Maturity Model, a companion piece to the book “Open Organization: Igniting Passion and Performance,” addresses many of the same concepts enmeshed in the values and mission of public service:

* Transparency
* Inclusivity
* Adaptability
* Collaboration
* Community

“An ‘open organization’—which I define as an organization that engages participative communities both inside and out—responds to opportunities more quickly, has access to resources and talent outside the organization, and inspires, motivates, and empowers people at all levels to act with accountability,” writes former Red Hat CEO and IBM President Jim Whitehurst in “Open Organization.“ “The beauty of an open organization is that it's not about pedaling harder, but about tapping into new sources of power both inside and outside to keep pace with all the fast-moving changes in your environment.”

Generally speaking, open by default is just the right thing to do. As the GOV.UK team mantras says, “Make things open: it makes things better.”
