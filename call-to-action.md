# Call to action

If you work in public service —as a government employee or private sector partner— society relies on you. Your civic responsibilities include a commitment to:

* Openness
* Inclusiveness
* Responsiveness
* Agility
* Resiliency

With the need to deliver services better and to recruit the next generation of leaders, government must adopt effective digital practices faster than ever before. We must commit to a twenty-first century standard of service that meets the public’s changing expectations and needs.

Delivering services in the digital age is not reserved for technologists. It is the work of everyone in government.

Together, we can and must build a government for, by and with all people.

#### Swear yourself in

Before getting started with this playbook, swear yourself in.

Raise your right hand and take the Proudly Serving pledge:

_I, \[YOUR NAME\], earnestly swear that I will proudly serve all people with a twenty-first century standard of service. I will hold myself and others accountable to this responsibility. Every day, I will do my part to build a government for, by and with all people._

Congratulations on taking the first step. Now, let’s start proudly serving.
