# Go .gov

### Overview <a href="#docs-internal-guid-c5670015-7fff-541c-672c-65adcf2550ec" id="docs-internal-guid-c5670015-7fff-541c-672c-65adcf2550ec"></a>

A .gov domain verifies that a website belongs to an official U.S. government entity. Getting a .gov domain is free and easy. Public organizations should adopt the .gov extension for all websites they operate.

### The problem

Misinformation is continuously spread on the internet, via websites and social media. Bad actors attempt to spoof official government websites with rogue sites to spread falsities or to steal personal information and money. Thousands of local government websites still use non-.gov domains. This lack of standard for government websites causes public confusion about what can be trusted as  official information.

### The solution

All official U.S. government websites should adopt the .gov domain extension. This universally communicates to the public that .gov websites are the sole, trusted online sources of  official government services and information.

### Context

Every website on the internet has a top-level domain, such as .com (commercial), .org (organization) or .gov (government). While most can be easily acquired by anyone through a number of commercial domain registries, the .gov extension is only one available to official U.S. government organizations.

These include:

* federal, state, local or territorial government entities
* tribal governments recognized by the federal or a state government
* other publicly controlled entities

Of note, the .gov domain cannot be used for:

* Commercial purposes
* Political campaigns
* Illegal content
* Malicious cyber activity

The .gov domain registry is operated by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.

Registration for a .gov domain is free. Government organizations simply apply for the domain at dotgov.gov and follow the instructions.

As the .gov registry website says, “It should be easy to identify governments on the internet, and using a .gov domain shows you’re official. The public shouldn’t have to guess whether the site they’re on or the email that hits their inbox is genuine.”
