# Remember why you do this

### Overview <a href="#docs-internal-guid-a3da0e49-7fff-a400-7be2-b03f52791400" id="docs-internal-guid-a3da0e49-7fff-a400-7be2-b03f52791400"></a>

Driving digital change in government is daunting. Yet, we push because we know our government needs fixing, now. This conviction carries us most days. But when it falters, we have to remember what drew us —and what’s at stake if we walk away.

### The problem

Public service demands compassion. We bear witness to people’s strife—and are entrusted to ease it, however we can. Sometimes we can’t help because of dated, flawed systems and processes. The friction imposed by them takes a psychological toll on our servants, citizens, and us who work within these systems and processes. It is natural to feel overwhelmed from the consistency or intensity of this friction. Over time, our compassion is tested, and sometimes even diminished.

It becomes problematic if we stay disillusioned. Calloused government leaders can’t effectively push for something better —and they can’t compassionately serve the public.

### The solution

We all have a reason—or several—we wanted to tackle the herculean task of improving public service. Something fired us up to do this hard work. Reminding ourselves of the initial spark, and reaching towards those who may embody it, is a balm when motivation runs low.

We also have to grant ourselves grace. Change at scale doesn’t happen overnight. Disappointments are inevitable. When missteps happen, we can’t lose sight of the mission.

### Context

Digital leaders evangelize change in a sector that defaults to the status quo. Embracing technology— but we know it’s not a panacea— we push the government to change the very way it solves problems. We’re working to put people’s needs at the center of government services, which frankly, isn’t standard.

Our work can be frustrating, tiresome and often thankless. But we roll-up our sleeves because there are problems that need solving, and we intend to be part of the solution.

Still, watching systems fail the public can be heavy. We feel deflated, even dejected at times. But we must keep the faith. If we don’t, we run the risk of becoming numb to the public’s needs.

We have to stay energized if we’re going to rally big change. Apathy robs us of compassion. We have to genuinely care about people’s needs if we’re going to build people-centered services.

Of course, this all begs the question: How do we endure?

The answer is rooted in what attracted us to this work. We chose the nobility of public service because we wanted to help people in tangible ways that scale. We have to remember that it’ll take time to see it through in earnest.

We also deserve to remember our wins—no matter their size. Transforming bureaucracies happens in countless strides, some of them baby steps, some of them major leaps.

When you feel downtrodden, look for the win. Even if you didn’t reach your goal, ask yourself where you gained some bit of knowledge that’ll help later.

For example, [Power to the Public](https://press.princeton.edu/books/ebook/9780691216638/power-to-the-public) authors Hana Schank and Tara Dawson McGuinness spotlight the State of Vermont’s effort to modernize how people apply for benefits. Through a small pilot program, the State transformed a paper-application process to a fully-automated version. It cut benefit delivery time in half.

Despite the success, the pilot project wasn’t adopted at scale (or at least that’s true at the time of this writing). This was due to a lack of internal support coupled with the pandemic.

Though it’s disappointing, there are plenty of wins. For starters, it’s a testament to what’s possible when change is piloted in small batches. It also taught staff the value of demoing prototypes to earn buy-in. These are lessons that’ll surely benefit future projects across government.

As author Mitchell Weiss so aptly put it in [We the Possibility](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=59242):  “We get the government we invent.” And we need inventors who have the conviction, compassion, and courage to take-on the fundamental problems in how we deliver public services. We need leaders who, despite the hard work, can persist for the public good.
