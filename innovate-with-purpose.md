# Innovate with purpose

### Overview

Government agencies can build a culture of innovation that survives organizational challenges and drives long-term results. Innovation starts with having the right foundation for sustainable, purpose-aligned programs.

### The problem

Innovation in the public sector has taken various forms with different levels of results that are not broadly shared. Compounding this, many widely-recognized innovation projects have struggled with long-term sustainability because of election cycles and changing leadership. Part of the challenge is a misunderstanding of what innovation is and how to codify it into a public organization’s operations.

### The solution

Understand that innovation is not the same as invention. Rather, innovation is finding adjacent possibilities for what you already have (technology, people, etc.). Recognize there is no silver bullet for a successful innovation program, but there are elements that can ensure lasting success.

### Context

Government agencies across the country have put an increasing focus on being innovative. Understanding how to define and operationalize innovation remains elusive. Compounding this, innovation is often confused with invention or idea generation. This is not, however, what drives innovation. Innovation is achieved when it’s embraced as an operating model and as the exploration of adjacent possibilities.

Once well-established, innovation must be codified to survive well beyond election cycles. This can be done through governance models that leverage internal and external stakeholders who provide stability (and diversity of thought along the way). A public agency should have a seat at the table — but not be the sole driver of an innovation program’s sustainability and resiliency.

Innovation is made possible by laying the right foundation and continuously building on it.

Foundationally, agencies must start by engaging their community ecosystem. This includes employees, businesses, academia, non-governmental organizations and other community organizations. This group should represent the diversity of the community and should not just be traditional ‘leaders.’

Next, agencies must align their innovation agenda with organizational or community challenges. They can align their agenda with pre-identified organizational or community goals (i.e., comprehensive plans, etc.) or leverage an open approach to help identify them. There are numerous tools and tactics that can solve this, including:

* Challenge-based procurement programs
* Open innovation platforms (i.e., idea collection)
* Joint-ventures
* Public-private partnerships (P3s)

Once an innovation project or set of projects are defined and mapped to community needs, it is vital to approach the delivery of innovation leveraging agile delivery methodologies. This means starting with a minimum viable product (MVP) of the  innovation. Continue to iterate over pre-defined ‘sprints’ (can be two weeks or one month) to continuously improve over time. Ensure that there are clearly defined milestones and key performance indicators to guide and benchmark the program along the way. (Tip: Empower stakeholders with the ability to drive innovation projects to build resiliency and further engagement in your program.)

Measure, adapt and repeat. Innovation is a continuous process. Once one cycle or project is complete, it is time to analyze what has been learned from the prior innovation cycle and move onto the next challenge to solve.

Lastly, look for opportunities to share success and collaborate with other government agencies. Although innovation programs may be regionally focused, there are tactics and best practices that can be applicable to all government agencies.

### Questions to ask

* Is my organization focused on solving a one-time effort or creating capacity to support innovation?
* Do I have stakeholders that represent the diversity of my overall community?
* What can I do to cultivate ideas and approaches from within and across my organization?
* What other organizations or jurisdictions can I partner with to scale our work and impact?
