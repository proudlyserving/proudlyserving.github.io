 - name: Shannah Hayley, City of Plano
   quote: "Digital is no longer a value-add for government service. Itâ€™s a core expectation of the communities we serve. The best way to navigate the complexities of the digital landscape is to learn from the experience and expertise of our colleagues. Writing for Proudly Serving was a great experience for our team as it allowed us to share our own lessons learned and priorities."
