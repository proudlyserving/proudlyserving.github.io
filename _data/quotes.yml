 - name: Shannah Hayley, City of Plano
   quote: "Digital is no longer a value-add for government service. It’s a core expectation of the communities we serve. The best way to navigate the complexities of the digital landscape is to learn from the experience and expertise of our colleagues. Writing for Proudly Serving was a great experience for our team as it allowed us to share our own lessons learned and priorities."

   quote: "Proudly Serving is a call to action and a rich mosaic of tools for civic and government leaders in the twenty-first century. Our shared commitment to building a government for, by, and with all people shines through each chapter. Writing for this project has been a great experience for our team of reimagining public service, distilling what's important to practice democracy together, and recognizing the part each of us has to play in moving beyond civics as usual. We hope that it grounds, resources, and inspires you."
