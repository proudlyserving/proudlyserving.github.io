# Think exponential

### Overview <a href="#docs-internal-guid-094ea796-7fff-03e1-d1bf-9c0f5ab96c40" id="docs-internal-guid-094ea796-7fff-03e1-d1bf-9c0f5ab96c40"></a>

The pace of change has picked up. We used to experience periods of stability between disruptions. Change is now perpetual, pervasive, and exponential. How do we build the systems, tools, and cultures that meet the changing needs of our communities today and into the future? We do it by thinking exponentially.

### The problem

While the world experiences exponential change, our public institutions change linearly. Even the most forward-thinking governments evolve incrementally. This creates an ever-widening gap between society's needs and government’s services. This is a multifaceted problem, as it challenges individuals and organizations in different ways that require diverse, and divergent approaches to create adaptive environments for exponential thinking.

### The solution

There is no one solution to addressing the exponential gap. There are thousands. These thousands of solutions come from practitioners like you, trying ideas far outside the box and sharing results for others to learn from and build on. This requires our organizations to be more experimental and risk-tolerant while working to develop systems for sharing results across organizations. The network of thousands of practitioners working to address the changing world creates systemic exponential thinking.

### Context

Exponential thinking is a bit of a misnomer because it’s not truly exponential in the defined sense. Here, we use exponential thinking as a mental model at the individual or group level for expanding the realm of possibilities.

Exponential thinking is rarely in fact new and is most often rooted in the combination of two or more existing ideas in a new way. The printing press is a good example. Johannes Gutenberg merged two ideas that had each been around for a few hundred years:  movable type and the grape press for winemaking. At the time, it seemed a novel improvement, yet it accelerated societal change through the speed and volume of the storage and sharing of ideas across the world.

For the individual, thinking exponentially is meant as thinking that breaks out of the linear tracks we usually operate within. This type of thinking comes naturally to children. Watch them mix and match toys, food, or clothes to see what the results are. Each new piece of knowledge exponentially exampands what is possible for them. This is usually trained out of us so we can put the square block through the square hole. However, we can take steps to bring this thinking back into our lives.

If this type of thought comes from multiple ideas being mushed together, then it can be facilitated by expanding our range of interests or expanding our network. Both approaches facilitate interaction with new ideas to play with and create novel thoughts, projects, or solutions. However, just like in our childhood, many concoctions should never be served during a holiday dinner, but occasionally something remarkable happens.

On the organizational level, exponential thinking can occur closer to its true definition because of the [network effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network\_effect) of many people working together. This collective exponential thinking can come from any group of affiliated individuals be it a club, neighborhood, business, or government.

The private sector benefits from exponential thinking as it creates a competitive advantage for gaining customers and donors. This incentive helps businesses tolerate the risk of experimentation.

Unfortunately, public bodies have the opposite incentives because we are risk-averse. We do our best to steward public resources and no staff nor elected officials want to be in the media for misuse of those resources. This risk aversion stands in opposition to our public entities’ obligation to address the exponential gap.

To meet this challenge, we in the public sector need to create environments for exponential thinking. While there are many ways to do this, public bodies can focus on three steps to facilitate exponential thinking:

1. Encourage creativity from staff and the community.
2. Create space for increased staff interactions across silos, organizations, and fields.
3. Increase the organization’s tolerance for risk.

How an organization takes these steps will be unique to the entity.

The multifaceted nature of exponential thinking in the public sphere will be challenging to overcome. It will challenge individuals. It will challenge our institutions. These challenges will be uncomfortable, so it’s crucial to remember that learning only happens outside the comfort zone.

### Mantras

* Growth comes from outside the comfort zone
* We are in this together

### Checklist

* Make time to learn new things outside of, but relevant to, your field
* Expand and maintain a network of adjacent professionals
* Help others address their challenges, as it’s a safe place for you to think outside the box
* Ask others outside your sphere to help frame or solve a challenge with you for diverse input
* Define goals before defining a problem or solution

### Questions to ask

* Am I, or are we, checking a box or making a difference?
* What underlying assumptions can and  should be challenged?
* Is the solution or opportunity we’re working on adaptable or static?
* How have others, inside and  outside my field, addressed a similar challenge or opportunity?&#x20;
* How will the next generation, or seventh, wish we acted?&#x20;
* Have we, or are we, sharing our successes and failures for others to learn from and improve on?&#x20;
