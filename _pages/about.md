Proudly Serving is a guide to building people-centered digital public services.

## Purpose

This is for everyone who:

* Serves the people
* Takes pride in their part
* Believes there is always a better way
* Does the hard work to deliver it

## How we work

Proudly Serving in an [open civic organization](https://oco.govfresh.com). We work this way because itâ€™s more fun and makes us better.
