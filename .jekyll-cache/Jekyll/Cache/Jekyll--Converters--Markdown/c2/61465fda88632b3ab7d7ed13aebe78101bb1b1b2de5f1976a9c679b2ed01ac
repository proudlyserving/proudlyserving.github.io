<p>With the need to deliver services better and to recruit the next generation of leaders, government must adopt effective digital practices faster than ever before. We must commit to a twenty-first century standard of service that meets the publicâ€™s changing expectations and needs.</p>

<p>Delivering services in the digital age is not reserved for technologists. It is the work of everyone in government.</p>

<p>Together, we can and must build a government for, by and with all people.</p>

<h2 id="swear-yourself-in">Swear yourself in</h2>

<p>Before getting started with this playbook, swear yourself in.</p>

<p>Raise your right hand and take the Proudly Serving pledge:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I, [YOUR NAME], earnestly swear that I will proudly serve all people with a twenty-first century standard of service. I will hold myself and others accountable to this responsibility. Every day, I will do my part to build a government for, by and with all people.</p>
</blockquote>
