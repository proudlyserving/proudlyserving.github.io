title: Reframe public service
description: "The pillars of public service include government, non-profit, business, media, academia, and the general public. By reframing our context for what it means to serve, we shift power dynamics from “the government” to “we are all public servants.” This empowers everyone to have a shared sense of responsibility, accountability, and unity."
