title: Reframe public service
description: "The pillars of public service include government, non-profit, business, media, academia, and general public. By reframing our context for what it means to serve, we shift power dynamics from “the government” to “we are all the government.” This empowers everyone to have a shared sense of responsibility, accountability, and unity."
