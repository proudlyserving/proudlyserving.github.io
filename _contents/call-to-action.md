If you work in public service — and in one way or another, we all do — your civic responsibilities include a commitment to:

* Openness
* Inclusiveness
* Responsiveness
* Agility
* Humility
* Resiliency

Delivering services in the digital age is not just the job of technologists or government officials. We must commit to a new standard that meets our changing needs and expectations.

Together, let’s serve for, by, and with all people.

## Swear yourself in

Before getting started, swear yourself in.

Take the Proudly Serving pledge:

> I, [YOUR NAME], earnestly swear that I will proudly serve with a new standard of public service. 
>
> Every day, I will do my part to serve for, by, and with all people.
>
> I will hold myself and others accountable to this responsibility.

Congratulations on taking the first step.

Let’s start proudly serving.
