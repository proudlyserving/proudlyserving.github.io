Your civic responsibilities include a commitment to:

* Openness
* Inclusiveness
* Responsiveness
* Agility
* Resiliency

With the need to deliver services better and to recruit the next generation of leaders, government must adopt effective digital practices faster than ever before. We must commit to a twenty-first century standard of service that meets the public’s changing expectations and needs.

Delivering services in the digital age is not reserved for technologists. It is the work of everyone in government.

Together, we can and must build a government for, by and with all people.
