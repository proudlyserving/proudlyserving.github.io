Before getting started with this playbook, swear yourself in.

Raise your right hand and take the Proudly Serving pledge:


> I, [YOUR NAME], earnestly swear that I will proudly serve all people with a twenty-first century standard of service. I will hold myself and others accountable to this responsibility. Every day, I will do my part to build a government for, by and with all people.

Congratulations on taking the first step. Now, letâ€™s start proudly serving.
