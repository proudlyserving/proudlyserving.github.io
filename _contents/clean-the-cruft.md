title: Clean the cruft
description: Every government solution—whether a policy, procedure, service, or system—follows a lifecycle. Gradually, these solutions can become outdated, no longer solving the right problem, or bogged down by aging processes or technology. Deprecation is a systematic way to phase out these unused or outdated solutions. Without it, government efforts can become ineffective, overload staff, and increase risks and costs.
