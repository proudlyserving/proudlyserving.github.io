Help write a playbook for local governments about building people-centered digital public services. 

Our goal is to finalize [Proudly Serving](https://proudlyservingbook.com/) by December 31, 2022. We created a [Table of contents](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d5jxA1kluWZ79GpiDE_VPxUsgs1jKjbVVSHAZVPRIPs/edit?usp=sharing) that lists the chapters we intend to include. The doc shows chapters as done or open for contribution.

If you are interested in writing one of the open chapters, complete the [contributor interest form](https://proudlyservingbook.com/contribute/). Weâ€™re also open to other suggestions if you want to write about a different topic. [Fill out the interest form](https://proudlyservingbook.com/contribute/) and let us know.
